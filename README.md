Circ
===

Meet Circ, our channel locked Ultimate IRC Bot. After recently deprecating
vini,  we decided to up the ante: to forge our own bot from scratch. No
forking, no outside code, but this time we can't leave #gnulag. All leading up
to eventually taking on one of IRC's biggest challenges, the agreeing on
something.

## Building

Requirements:

* `cmake`
* `make`
* a C compiler
* `libunistring-dev`
* `libev-dev`

```
