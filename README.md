Circ
===

Meet Circ, our channel locked Ultimate IRC Bot. After recently deprecating
vini,  we decided to up the ante: to forge our own bot from scratch. No
forking, no outside code, but this time we can't leave #gnulag. All leading up
to eventually taking on one of IRC's biggest challenges, the agreeing on
something.

## Building

Requires `cmake`, `make`, and a C compiler.

```
./build.sh
```

## Running

Circ is configured by environment variables. See `lib/config` for more information.

```
./start.sh
```
